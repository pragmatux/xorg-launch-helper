Description: Wrapper to launch Xorg and notify systemd
 Xorg-launch-helper is a small utility that transforms the X server
 process (XOrg) into a daemon that can be used to make applications
 wait with starting until XOrg is ready for X11 connections.
 .
 The utility starts and forks the XOrg server and listens for a
 signal from the XOrg server. At this point, the utility signals
 systemd READY through sd_notify(). At this point systemd
 will start units that have an explicit ordering configured
 to be after the xorg.target.
 .
 This mechanism can be used to delay the starting up of services
 that require a working X11 display server, such as any form
 of graphical process or X11 window manager.
